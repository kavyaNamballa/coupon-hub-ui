        <strong>Our Mission</strong>
        <br />
        Our mission is simple: to connect people through the exchange of

        expire, leading to missed opportunities for savings. By providing a
        platform where users can upload and share their unused coupons, we aim
        to reduce waste and maximize savings for everyone.
